# Next JS Auth Practice


Next.js Auth Practice is a simple authentication playground built for practicing authentication flows in Next.js applications. This README file serves as a guide to help you understand how to use Next.js Auth Practice to explore and experiment with authentication concepts.

### Features

- **Mock Authentication**: Simulate authentication scenarios without the need for real user accounts or credentials.
- **Customizable UI**: Customize the authentication UI to experiment with different login and registration forms.
- **Session Simulation**: Simulate user sessions and explore session management concepts.
- **Easy Setup**: Quick setup process to get started with experimenting with authentication in Next.js applications.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to start practicing authentication using Next.js Auth Practice:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Next.js Auth Practice repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clonehttps://github.com/Abhay3333/Next-auth-practice.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm or yarn.

   ```bash
   cd Next-auth-practice
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cd Next-auth-practice
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**: Start the Next.js development server to run the Auth Practice application locally.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Explore Authentication**: Access the Auth Practice application in your web browser and start exploring different authentication scenarios.

### Usage

- **Login**: Use the provided login form to simulate user authentication. Experiment with different authentication states such as successful login, failed login, and authentication errors.
- **Registration**: Explore the registration form to simulate user registration flows. Test validation rules and error handling.
- **Session Management**: Experiment with session management concepts such as session expiration, session persistence, and session invalidation.

### Example

Here's an example of how you can use Next.js Auth Practice to simulate a login scenario:

1. Navigate to the login page of the Auth Practice application.
2. Enter a test username and password into the login form.
3. Submit the form to simulate a login attempt.
4. Observe the application's behavior based on the simulated authentication outcome.






### Acknowledgments

Next.js Auth Practice is inspired by the need for a simple and customizable authentication playground for developers to experiment with authentication concepts in Next.js applications.
